						<p> Once a company decides to move to the cloud, one of the hardest decisions they will make is choosing a vendor. There is no right or wrong answer here, as the decision depends on your companies specific needs and whether you are looking for IaaS, PaaS, SaaS or all three.</p>

						<p> We are software agnostic but have established partnerships and work with many of the top cloud providers, including those listed below. </p>
