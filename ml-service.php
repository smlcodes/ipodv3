						<p> The growth of cloud computing has given one crucial thing, which is the storage function. Data generated by our team is enormous and to store it more securely is an important decision. Machine Learning makes use of data for deriving decisions, and when data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to refer the information for precise purposes. As the assistance offered by cloud computing is cheaper, our team use cloud services for their data storage needs as it provided maximum security and accessibility in remote locations.</p>
